intro: |
  I am a keen technologist and software developer that loves thinking of innovative solutions to both company-specific and industry-wide problems. I achieve results through using my technical knowledge, logical thinking and problem solving skills.<br><br>
  By working on various research projects, I have become proficient with computing languages such as Python (in the field of machine learning and robotics), Java (for both web development and Android applications) and C# (to develop applications in VR/AR). I also have experience in database creation, querying and management mostly through SQL.<br><br>
  I have also assumed the role of project manager on a few occasions, most notably on an application delivery project for BT's Emergency Response Team. This first hand experience of Agile leading will benefit me for future projects.
